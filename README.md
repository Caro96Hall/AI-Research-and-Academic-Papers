Academic Papers in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science

About
This repository contains a collection of academic papers authored during my Master of Science in Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, as well as my work as a Research Fellow. These papers reflect my dedication to advancing knowledge in various fields within AI and Computer Science, ranging from Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Cognitive Science.

Areas of Focus
1. Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Social Robotics
HRI Research Paper: Meta-Analysis of Social Robotics: A comprehensive meta-analysis exploring the levels of embodiment in humanoid robots and their impact on human-robot interaction. This paper bridges the gap between technical implementations and user-centered evaluations.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP Paper 1 & NLP Paper 2: These papers investigate the challenges of conversational AI, analyzing datasets (e.g., DailyDialog and ConvAI2) and their alignment with conversational intentions based on Searle's speech act theory.
3. Data Mining and Evolutionary Computing
Data Mining Techniques Papers 1 & 2: Studies focused on leveraging advanced data mining algorithms to extract insights and identify patterns in diverse datasets.
Evolutionary Computing Paper: Explored optimization problems and their solutions using evolutionary algorithms.
4. AI Ethics and Societal Impact
AI and Society Papers 1 & 2: Investigated the ethical considerations and societal implications of artificial intelligence systems, focusing on the balance between innovation and responsible deployment.
5. Cognitive Science and Multi-Agent Systems
Cognitive Science Paper: An interdisciplinary exploration of AI systems inspired by human cognitive processes.
Multi-Agent Systems Paper: Analyzed agent-based models for problem-solving and optimization in distributed environments.
6. Robotics and System Design
Socially Intelligent Robotics - NAOfit: This paper details the design and implementation of a socially intelligent system using the NAO robot, focusing on its applications in fitness coaching.
7. Communicative Robotics
Communicative Robots Group Paper & Personal Report: A detailed study of automatic dialogue evaluation metrics, conversational flow, and agent memory in communicative robots.
